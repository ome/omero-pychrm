# Shortcut for connecting to OMERO servers
#
# To use this rename servers.conf.example to servers.conf in the current

#
# #name host      port username password
# local localhost 4064 test1    test1
#
# In ipython you can run
# > import connect
# > co = connect.XXX()
# to connect, where XXX is one of the shortnames in the servers.conf
